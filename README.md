# ML_Logistic_Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical method for predicting a binary outcome (1/0, Yes/No, True/False) given a set of independent variables. It is a generalized linear model (GLM) type and uses a logistic function (also called the sigmoid function) to model a binary dependent variable.
